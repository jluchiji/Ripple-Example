Ripple-Example
==============


##Project Description
Example of the 2D simulated ripple effect in WinForms + C#.
For more details, please refer to [my blog article](http://www.wyvernzora.com/2012/12/ripple-effect-in-winforms-c.html).

RippleEffect is a complete implementation of the 2D simulated liquid effect that can be applied to any bitmap. RipplePictureBox, however, only serves as an example of how to use the RippleEffect class. It may be functional but it is in no way complete. You can use it if you want, but it requires a lot of work to make it usable.
